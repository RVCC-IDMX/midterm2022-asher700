            <p>
                My name is Asher Levin, I live in Springfield, IL. 
                I'm a 32 year old senior web developer
                While I am hoping that my work and my reputation precedes me,
                I will attempt to educate those who don't know of my marvelous
                works and who I am. 
                I like strong coffee and often when I am not vigorously coding
                webpages I like to sit outside and meditate. I have worked on a
                wide variety of websites, ranging from that of news network all 
                the way to personal startups. I have 20 years of experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                "Truly phenomenal work. I was tempted to ship him one of my awards
                myself. A real visionary as far as web page development goes."

                "Its like he could code with his friggin mind, man.
                I thought I had died and gone to heaven once I saw the 
                duck thing. I could not have had my wishes for the perfect 
                website better fulfilled, totally worth the money."
